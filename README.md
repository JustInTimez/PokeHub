# PokeHub
This website is a basic fullstack web app with the theme of Pokemon!
I've tried to incorporate the feel of old Pokemon GBA game aesthetics. There is obviously a lot to improve on.

The idea was to create a sort of Pokedex that a user can visit to review stat information on a specific Pokemon. Adding functionality in the form of a favoriting system that allows the user to add any Pokemon to their favorites, and have quick access to viewing that information from their account page.

Stack used...
- Backend:
    - [X] MySQL
    - [X] PHP - Slim4 Framework for API endpoints
- Frontend:
    - [X] Vanilla JavaScript
    - [X] Bootstrap5
    - [X] HMTL & CSS




 Pokemon website that requires a sign up to be able to view the Pokemon database. Using JavaScript API's to communicate with the backend system (Slim Framework) to display Pokemon data, filter search results and to have a favoriting system for the Trainers (users)


## Description
